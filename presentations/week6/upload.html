  Considering i like the look of clean websites, i would make the Logo stand out while the other textboxes and background is simple..drawing the most attention to the logo and images.
  I would use a big, bold and black font and make the background white and keep my images in color so again make it stand out!
  If this restuarant was a Vegan local place, i would include all the ingredients that are used in the dishes, as well as what it replaces in a non-vegan meal.
  On the mobile layout i would float the description on the opposite side of the image so it is slightly eaiser to read then constantly scrolling downwards.
